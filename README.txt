1> How do I add my social links?

   Setting up social media is extremely easy in PixelHunter as it comes with some major social icons out of the box. You just add the links(including http://) at the theme customizer under 'Social Links' section on the respective fields.

2>	How do I add my (Author) description and my social links for that Author Bio feature of the theme?

	PixelHunter pulls your description from Users->Your Profile->Biographical Info
	So you will write your description there. For adding your Facebook, Twitter links textboxes are available there.

 3> I don't like the default theme features like Author Bio at each post, Random posts widget. Now what?

 	If you don't like these features you can just disable them at 'Disable Features' section at theme customizer.

4> This theme is so ugly. Now what?

	If you hate that default green color and header background then you can easily change it on the theme customizer by changing primary and secondary colors  to instantly change the color scheme of the theme.

 	Rest of the features like logo upload, backgroud color, background image, etc are also available at theme customizer as you would expect for more customization.
