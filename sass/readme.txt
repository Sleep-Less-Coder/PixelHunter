SASS source has been removed as they aren't required in production environment.
Only the compiled 'main.css' file has been kept to keep theme lightweight but if you want to extend/customize the theme further, it is highly recommened that you use the SASS structure as it is quite easy and maintainable. Yeah! if you hate 3000 lines of css junk!
